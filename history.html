<br><br>
The AZ Fairbank Train Heist took place on February 15, 1900, when 5 bandits robbed a train in a firefight. They fled to the Dragoon mountains, aided by their conspirators among the pursuing party. All bandits were eventually brought to justice, although it took nearly 10 years for the entire gang to get there. Jeff Milton was credited with foiling what should have been an incredibly successful heist.

<br><br>
The Aztec Land & Cattle Company, or the "Hashknife Brand" was responsible for the most exciting event ever to take place in Santa Fe. The Santa Fe railroad was robbed by four bandits from Hashknife, who were chased and shot at by Sheriff William "Buckney" O'Neill for the better part of 5 days. Unfortunately, the good guys won in the end.
