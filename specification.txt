Post Client Meeting objectives.

Aspect ratio on resize.  (Just use fixed values for now).

As the page resizes no matter what platform the site is viewed on a phone horizontally the content should be consistent.  Test the site on the mobile platform.  Usability on the phone.  Text larger.  Use the whole screen.

CSS embed a cool font, like the wanted poster font.

Plot page: too much scrolling.  Don't want to scroll down.

Next update from client:

Make the plot page clickable.  Thumbnail images which expand on clicking.  A storyboard.  

Short text which, when clicked, an image appears and a fulsome description of the picture appears.  Boxes appear with full size image and associated text.  User not overwhelmed and presented with only what he wants to see.
